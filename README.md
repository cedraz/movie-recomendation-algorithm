# How to run recommendation algorithm

## 1. Install the required libraries
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Download the dataset

use this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv

put the file in the root directory of the project

## 3. Run the algorithm
run each cell in the notebook `recommendation.ipynb`

### Note
The dataset is too large to be uploaded to the repository, so you have to download it from the link provided in step 2. If you use a dataset with more than 10000 movies, the algorithm will take a long time to run, or it may not run at all.
